This file is a placeholder for the images directory.

In a real project, you would need to add the following images:
1. hero.jpg - A large banner image for the hero section
2. college.jpg - An image of the college building for the about section
3. it.jpg - An image representing IT programs
4. economics.jpg - An image representing economics programs
5. design.jpg - An image representing design programs

Since we can't create actual image files in this environment, you would need to:
1. Find appropriate royalty-free images
2. Optimize them for web use (compress them to reduce file size)
3. Save them in this directory with the filenames mentioned above
4. Make sure they match the dimensions expected in the CSS (especially for the program cards which expect 300px width images)

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder image services like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/
- https://placehold.co/

Example URLs:
- https://picsum.photos/1200/600 (for hero.jpg)
- https://picsum.photos/600/400 (for college.jpg)
- https://picsum.photos/300/200 (for program images)
